					Selectors just like the elements of nature(“Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked...) and they all have a different property based on the value given to the(water becomes ice at 0degrees celcius).
				</p>

				<p>
					At times the elements of nature have a special state for instance water changes its properties under extreme conditions ;this feature is similar to pseudo-classes which cater to the special state of a tag and is added to the tag using the colon symbol. As for pseudo-elements,it reflects on how the specific part of a tag is changed(e.g pink-dyed water specifically changes the color of water and that's it)

						Have you ever been criticised for being lazy by your loving parents but they themselves oddly seem to share that trait....yes inheritance. Children tags inherit the properties and values of their parents when it is not specified. When it is specified individually, it is similar to breaking that much needed lazy cycle.
					</p>

						<h4>Combinator selectors</h4>
						They work in regards to inheritance. Let's take the example of <br><h5>
						div p {} </h5><br>
						The space observed between tags in this combinator selector is like the generation gaps between you and your ancestors but your eyes are still a beautiful brown because like p you have inherited the characterics of your ancestor. The example illustrated above is called the descendant selector. 
						Next up we will investigate the example  of  <br><h5>
							article > p {} </h5><br>
							The greater than symbol(>) can be seen as parents introducing their children to others and them saying proudly "yes this is my child right here" while pointing at them. And you guessed it right ,this combinator selector is called a child selector.
							Another illustration that is as interesting is<br><h5>
							h1 + p {} </h5><br>
							The addition symbol is used for adjacent sibling selectors in the same way it's always a plus to have them around and help with the chores...but also in your life ofcourse.


						</p>

						<p>
							As we have seen previously, pseudo-class selectors bring out a specific state of a tag. We can see that in terms of how sometimes genes can skip generations ony to be applied to someone.<br>

						Every content within your webpage is in a box so the question has to be asked ; why is it called the box model and not the circle model or heart model. The answer is quite simple actually...for the sake of simplicity.A box takes the shape of a quadrilateral which only requires four straight lines to be drawn. This understood ,the box model is an embodiment of most technological devices available today.  
					</p>

					<p>
						To understand the box model, think of it as ordering a TV from overseas and it being shipped to you. The tv is protected with polystyrene in the same way the content of a box is protected with padding.The outside of the box comprises of the border and the margin seperates the box(both tv and content box) from other similar boxes .
